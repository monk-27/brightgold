    desc: "In Aqua Regia, 99.9% pure metallic gold is obtained. This process can be employed on a large scale. A primary step of the process is to dissolve the precious metals and some impurities. Aqua Regia combines nitric acid and hydrochloric acid so that some silver remains in solution and some forms a silver chloride precipitate. Silver content must also be taken into consideration. There is no doubt that silver chloride formation negatively affects gold dissolution. As soon as the dissolution is complete, the solution and precipitate are separated by filtration. A reducing agent such as ferrous sulphate, sulfur dioxide, or sodium bisulphate is used to reduce the gold in the solution. High-purity gold powder is then obtained that can be melted. The platinum group metals remain in solution when gold precipitates, so they must be recovered in another way.",
